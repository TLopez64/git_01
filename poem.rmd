In the land where cacti cast their shadow long,  
Lived a man named El Chapo, both fierce and strong.  
A legend in the world of crime, his name resounds,  
With stories of his daring and the undergrounds.  

Born Joaquín Guzmán, he rose with stealth,  
Through tunnels dark and ill-gotten wealth.  
With power that could rival a desert storm,  
He navigated danger, a figure to deform.  

In Mexico's sierras, he reigned supreme,  
A drug lord's empire, like a fevered dream.  
Through mountains and valleys, his empire spread,  
A web of corruption, where many bled.  

El Chapo, they called him, the short in stature,  
But his influence loomed large, a criminal actor.  
Escaping prisons, like a wily fox,  
He left authorities bewildered by paradox.  

Yet his legacy's not one of admiration,  
But a cautionary tale of crime's fascination.  
In the world of shadows, he made his name,  
But in the end, it brought him shame.  

For crime's a path that leads to despair,  
A web of darkness, a heavy snare.  
El Chapo's story, a lesson clear,  
That even the mighty can fall, I fear.
