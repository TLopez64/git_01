## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,  
   As he landed his crew with care;  
Supporting each man on the top of the tide  
   By a finger entwined in his hair.  

"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Some say the world will end in fire,  
Some say in ice.  
From what I’ve tasted of desire  
I hold with those who favor fire.  
But if it had to perish twice,  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  


## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In the land where cacti cast their shadow long,  
Lived a man named El Chapo, both fierce and strong.  
A legend in the world of crime, his name resounds,  
With stories of his daring and the undergrounds.  

Born Joaquín Guzmán, he rose with stealth,  
Through tunnels dark and ill-gotten wealth.  
With power that could rival a desert storm,  
He navigated danger, a figure to deform.  

In Mexico's sierras, he reigned supreme,  
A drug lord's empire, like a fevered dream.  
Through mountains and valleys, his empire spread,  
A web of corruption, where many bled.  

El Chapo, they called him, the short in stature,  
But his influence loomed large, a criminal actor.  
Escaping prisons, like a wily fox,  
He left authorities bewildered by paradox.  

Yet his legacy's not one of admiration,  
But a cautionary tale of crime's fascination.  
In the world of shadows, he made his name,  
But in the end, it brought him shame.  

For crime's a path that leads to despair,  
A web of darkness, a heavy snare.  
El Chapo's story, a lesson clear,  
That even the mighty can fall, I fear.
